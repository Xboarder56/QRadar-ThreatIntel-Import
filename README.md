# QRadar-ThreatIntel-Import
Automatic Threat Intel Importer

This repo contains custom QRadar scripts that I utilize in my home lab to automatically pull threat intelligence into the SIEM. I have released them for anyone to utilize in their own QRadar instance. If you have any questions you can create an issue for the GitHub project or open a question/reply on the IBM QRadar CE forms located at: https://ibm.biz/qradarceforums

# Scripts
  - AV_Reputation/AV_Reputation.sh
    - AV_Reputation_refSet.sh

# Notes
  - As I get more time I will develop addition scripts to parse newer threat feeds. If you have a request leave an issue on the repo with a link to the threat feed download and I will see if I can get the time to parse it!

# Change Log
  - 01-29-2019 - Created a reference set version of (AV_Reputation) import script. This allows for avoiding the deploy changes and provides better performance.
  - 01-28-2019 - Initial Upload of AV_Reputation (AlienVault) import script.
